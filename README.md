# zoBdayProj

An animated birthday card for a friend :).

This uses several ideas learned in lyubomirShoylev/pythonBook to exercise them, as well as some other:

* simple GUI using the TkInter for Python;
* simple multithreading to allow for a simultaneous animation and sound;
* the compilation of the program to an .exe file;
* editing of .exe file icon and so forth.
